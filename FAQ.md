### Q: How do I use offline synced lyrics?
There are two methods for how to get offline synced lyrics.

#### Method 1:-
##### STEP 1:  
Find the time stamped lyrics for your songs which don't have lyrics already. A time stamped lyrics looks like this, "[00:04:02] Some lyrics text" for example.
##### STEP 2: 
Copy these time stamped lyrics.
##### STEP 3: 
Open retro music and head to the song synced lyrics editor.
##### STEP 4: 
Paste the lyrics there normally and exit the editor
##### STEP 5: 
Open lyrics and you should see your time stamped lyrics there.

#### Method 2:-
##### STEP 1: 
Find the ".lrc" files for your songs which doesn't have lyrics already.
##### STEP 2: 
A ".lrc" is like a text file which contains the time stamped lyrics for example, "[00:04:02] Some lyrics text"
##### STEP 3: 
Now you have to rename the file you created in this way: <song_name> - <artist_name>.lrc or for better matching copy the <song_name> and the <artist_name> from the tag editor and then rename the file.
##### STEP 4: 
You have to copy or move this file into a location on the SD Card: whatever_sdcard/RetroMusic/lyrics/ and paste it there.
Finally you will be able to see the lyrics working.

> If you want to skip to particular time stamp, simply scroll to the time stamp from where you want to start from and a 'Play' icon will appear left to the particular stamp. Tap on play button to play from there.


### Q: Why isn't the artist's image downloading?
Last.fm has disabled the download of artist's images for the time being, whether functionality for this will be restored in future is uncertain.

### Q: How do I change the theme?
Settings -> Look and feel -> Select your theme.

### Q: Why aren't last added songs showing?
Settings -> Other -> Last added playlist interval -> Select an option from the list.

### Q: How do I enable fullscreen lockscreen controls?
Settings -> Personalize -> Fullscreen controls -> Enable (this will only be visible when songs are playing from Retro Music).

### Q: Why are gallery or random pictures showing up as album art?
Settings -> Images -> Ignore media store covers -> Enable

### Q: Which file types are supported?
Retro Music uses the native media player that comes with your Android phone, so as long as a file type is supported by your phone, it's supported by Retro Music.

### Q: Why is my device slowing down when I'm using the app?
Retro Music is image intensive, it keeps images in the cache for quick loading.

### Q: The title "Retro Music" is showing on the top of the app, how can i fix this? 
Clear the app's cache and data.

#### Q: My app is crashing, how do i fix this? (Sorry, settings have changed internally) 
Reinstalling the app should fix this issue. 

#### Q: Why has all the text gone white/dissapeared? 
Change the theme to Black or Dark and change it back to what you had before.

#### Q: Why some of my songs are not showing in my library?
Try checking up if those songs are not less than 30 seconds, if so head to settings -> other -> filter song duration. Put this to zero and see the songs should start appearimg in the library.
If this doesn't work out for you, re-scanning the media folder should help and subsquently rebooting the device to refresh media store.
At last resort, If nothing worked and your audio files are stored in SD card. Try moving them to internal memory then back to SD card.

#### Q: Why my playlist/playlist songs keep disappearing?
Playlist/Playlist songs disappearing is based on android media store system. Save those playlist as file(Tap on three dot menu next to available playlist and save as file) and it should get fixed.

#### Q: Why does my library shows song files twice or no song at all?
If you are seeing duplication of songs in the library or no songs at all, then it's because of Media Store issue which got affected by some other app. 
To fix this:
• Head to your device settings
• Open up "Apps & notifications" (This name depends from ROM to ROM)
• Find 'Media storage' app and clear storage (both data and cache) of it.
• Then open Retro Music app and manually scan your music from your storage. 
• Reboot the device to refresh media store (Not sure if this is necessary)

NOTE: Don't panic when you will open Retro Music and see "Zero" songs there in the library. It's because you cleared Media Store which is responsible for recognising files on your device.
